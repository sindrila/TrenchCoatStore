# Technical details

The app follows a layered architecture with four main components: GUI, Service, Repository, and Domain:
- **GUI layer** is responsible for the user interface and interaction using Qt framework. To fetch and display the images of trench coats, it uses curl and opencv libraries.
- **Service layer** provides the business logic and functionality of the app, such as adding, updating, or removing trench coats.
- **Repository layer** handles the available trench coat entities, as well as the user shopping cart.
- **Domain layer** defines the entities and models of the app, such as TrenchCoat
